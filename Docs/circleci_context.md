## CircleCI Context Variables and Fastlane Integration

### Overview

This document explains how CircleCI context variables interact with Fastlane during CI/CD processes.

### Flow of CircleCI Context Variables with Fastlane

1. **Defining Contexts in CircleCI**

   - In the `config.yml` file of CircleCI, you specify contexts to manage environment variables securely.

2. **Automatic Injection of Environment Variables**

   - CircleCI automatically injects these context variables as environment variables before running the job.

3. **Accessing Context Variables in Fastlane**

   - When Fastlane runs, it accesses these environment variables through Ruby's `ENV` hash.

4. **Verifying Environment Variables in CircleCI**
   - The `verify-credentials` job in `config.yml` checks if required variables exist before proceeding.

```yaml
- run:
    name: Verify Required Environment Variables
    command: |
      : "${FASTLANE_USER:?Missing FASTLANE_USER}"
      : "${REAN_APP_IDENTIFIER:?Missing REAN_APP_IDENTIFIER}"
```

### Summary of Flow

```
CircleCI Context → Environment Variables → Fastlane ENV[] access
```

### Benefits

- **No need for EnvCredentialsManager**: Since CircleCI handles setting up these environment variables, you don’t need an additional credential management system in Fastlane.

Would you like guidance on verifying these variables within your Fastlane scripts?
