Absolutely â€” hereâ€™s a **clear, no-fluff guide** to help you use **React Query confidently** in real projects, especially in React Native:

---

## âœ… What You Actually Need to Know (90% Use Case)

### 1. **useQuery** â†’ for GET requests (fetching data)

```tsx
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['users'],
  queryFn: fetchUsers,
});
```

* **Caching** is automatic.
* React Query tracks `loading`, `error`, and `data` state.
* Add `staleTime` if you donâ€™t want frequent refetches.

---

### 2. **useMutation** â†’ for POST/PUT/DELETE (sending data)

```tsx
const mutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: addUser,
  onSuccess: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['users'] }); // refetch users list
  },
});
```

* `mutation.mutate(data)` triggers the action.
* You can also use `onError`, `onSettled`, etc.

---

### 3. **invalidateQueries** â†’ force refetch (after mutation)

```tsx
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['users'] });
```

* This is how you **update the UI** with fresh server data after something changes (like creating or deleting).

---

### 4. **queryKey** â†’ used for caching and refetch control

```ts
['posts']                  // base key
['posts', category]        // scoped with filter
['user', userId]           // scoped to specific data
```

Always:

* Make it **stable** (not an inline object)
* Use different keys for different data

---

### 5. **You can still use Axios or fetch**

React Query is **not** a replacement for HTTP libraries. Just plug your existing service function into `queryFn` or `mutationFn`.

---

### 6. **Prefetching and manual refetch**

```ts
queryClient.prefetchQuery({ queryKey: ['data'], queryFn: fetchData });
refetch(); // manually trigger refetch
```

## ðŸ§  When You Might Feel Confused

| Confusion                 | Tip                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| POST that just gets data? | Still use `useQuery`, not `useMutation`           |
| When to refetch?          | After mutation â†’ `invalidateQueries()`            |
| Hook not triggering?      | Add `enabled: true/false` for conditional queries |
| Cache not updating?       | Use correct `queryKey` and `invalidateQueries()`  |

## âœ… Checklist to Use in Project

* [x] `useQuery` for all **GET**/fetching
* [x] `useMutation` for **writing** (POST, PUT, DELETE)
* [x] `queryKey` is **clear and stable**
* [x] After mutation, call `invalidateQueries()`
* [x] Use your own Axios/fetch for requests

If you follow that, you're using React Query correctly 95% of the time.

- The onSuccess callback is called when the mutation is successful.
- The onError callback is called when the mutation encounters an error. during http post call. The error is 
passed in react query promise chain. on the OnError callback can handle the error wihout us havin to pass though service then to the hook then to the component.
